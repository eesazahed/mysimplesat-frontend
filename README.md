# MySimpleSAT

MySimpleSAT is an android app I built with React Native.

This app gives you real SAT-style practice problems and an interactive review session.
After each problem, you'll reflect on mistakes and guesses, helping you track patterns and avoid similar errors on the actual test.
I created this app while I was studying for the SAT. It started as a personal project, but I had three clear goals in mind from the beginning:

1. I wanted to improve my own SAT preparation. By building this app, I had the opportunity to solve a ton of practice problems.
2. I wanted to create a helpful and free resource for other students who are preparing for the SAT.
3. I saw this as an opportunity to practice and improve my mobile development skills. I also used this app to apply for a grant through Hack Club.

If you have any thoughts, suggestions, or feedback, I'd love to hear them.
