    <p>Are you preparing for your next SAT?</p>

    <p>
      This app gives you real SAT-style practice problems and an interactive
      review session.
    </p>

    <p>
      After each problem, you&apos;ll reflect on mistakes and guesses, helping
      you track patterns and avoid similar errors on the actual test.
    </p>

    <p>
      I created this app while I was studying for the SAT. It started as a
      personal project, but I had three clear goals in mind from the beginning:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        I wanted to improve my own SAT preparation. By building this app, I had
        the opportunity to solve a ton of practice problems.
      </li>

      <li>
        I wanted to create a helpful and free resource for other students who
        are preparing for the SAT.
      </li>

      <li>
        I saw this as an opportunity to practice and improve my mobile
        development skills. I also used this app to apply for a grant through
