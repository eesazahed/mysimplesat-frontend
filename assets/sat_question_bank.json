The inequalities define a region bounded by these two lines and the y-axis ($x \\ge 0$). Let's find the vertices of this triangle. Vertex 1 (intersection of the two lines): $-x+4 = x-2 \\implies 2x=6 \\implies x=3$. Then $y=3-2=1$. So, (3,1). Vertex 2 (y-intercept of $y=-x+4$): (0,4). Vertex 3 (y-intercept of $y=x-2$): (0,-2). The base of the triangle is the distance between (0,4) and (0,-2), which is 6. The height is the x-coordinate of the intersection point, which is 3. The area is $(1/2) \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = (1/2) \\times 6 \\times 3 = 9$."
